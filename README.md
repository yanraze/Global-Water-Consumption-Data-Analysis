## RECOMENDATIONS

- Strengthen policies in high-consumption countries (India, China, U.S.) and promote water-efficient technologies.

- Reduce India’s high agricultural water consumption with drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and sustainable farming.

- Encourage water recycling in the U.S. and enforce stricter regulations on industrial water use.

- Invest in smart water grids and leak detection in China to reduce municipal waste.

- Investigate and curb excessive water use in Turkmenistan through efficiency programs.

- Promote international partnerships and public-private initiatives for sustainable water management.
